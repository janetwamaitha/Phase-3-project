# Tanzania Water Wells

## Introduction
The project is on Tanzania Water Wells. The project can be found at https://github.com/janetwamaitha/Phase-3-project

In the repository you will find the following:
* Jupyter Notebook - contains all the code that was written
* README file - contains a brief descripiton of the project
* data folder - contains the data that was provided and used in the project
* column names text file - describes the column names
* A presentation pdf - contains a non-technical presentation of the project

## Project Objectives:
* Identifying the top five factors contributing to the condition of the waterpoints.
*  Give recommendations based on the factors identified for the next constructions and repairs.

## Methods Used
* Supervised Learning- MultiClass Classification
* Decision Trees
* Ensemble Methods- Random Forests
* XGBoost Model

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
Tanzania is a developing country with a population of over 57,000,000.The government wants to improve the water supply in the country by maximizing on the functional waterpoints and repairing the non-functional water points. The goal of the project is to use Machine Learning Models to help predict which factors are contributing to the condition of the water points. Once the factors are identified they will provide a starting point for the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in building and repairing the waterpoints.

## Needs of the project
- data scientists
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Data Visualization

## Benefits of the project
Through the project the Government of Tanzania through the Ministry of Water and Irrigation was able to:
* Identify the factors affecting the condition of the water points
* Use the factors identified to determine the construction of new water points and improving the existing waterpoints.
